Get ready to win some new toys and balls in the all-new claw machine! 

A player will control a claw machine that traverses a hermite-spline curved track. To extend the claw down, the player must press the drop button at the right time over their desired toy, and down a chain, and grabber will extend. 
Next, the player must correctly open and close the joints of the rigid-body pinchers and time the clawâ€™s grab. Should the claw collide with the toy(s), the claw will either be able to pick it up or be knocked off the winning path.
The player will view the game from a first-person point-of-view, looking into the widow of the claw machine.
